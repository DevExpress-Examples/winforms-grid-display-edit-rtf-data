' How to display rich text in GridView's cells, but edit their content in a popup window
' 
' This example demonstrates how to provide different editors for displaying and
' editing data. In this scenario, cells values can be edited using the
' RichEditControl located in the popup window. However, the
' RepositoryItemRichTextEdit is used to display cells content when their in-place
' editor is closed.
